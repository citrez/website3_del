<p style="text-align: center;">Here is a collection of things that I love to use.
I hope to update this regularly</p>



## R and packages
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for me is the definitive guide to Data Science in R and can help you think about data problems. It is both highly approachable and will really get you quite far along with your data needs. 

- *The* resource for building package in R. [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham.
- I used hugo and blogdown to create this site. [The blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is the best place to start and [this blog](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/) is a nice primer.

- [Tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) for interpretable ways of gaining insight from text data

## Bloggers
- [Mike Dane's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw) you tube channel is **very** good. I used him to learn about hugo, which was used to build this site, but there is a lot more on there.

- [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/projects/) is a recent find and an absoloute teasure strove of information. 

[Cedric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/), what a man, what a blog. 

- Julia Silge has an incredible youtube channel, taking you through all things tidymodeling. Super useful resource, if, like me, you'd like a framework to rival scikit-learn that will keep you safely within the confines of Rstudio. She also has a [blog](https://juliasilge.com/)

- [Ryans tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/) are a cool resource for introductionary lesson to some programming fundementals

- [Story Bench](https://www.storybench.org/category/how-to/) has tons of interesting bloggs

- [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) with Josh Stalmer provides simple explanations of all things Stats/ML and comes with a healthy dose of ironic uekele playing, whats not to like?! DOIBLE BAMM. 

-[fireship](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA) for all my interest in webdev. Offers great youtube 100 second snippets. 

## Visualising

- The [R Graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) and this website as a whole is an absolutely indispensable resource. Not only does it have practically every visualization that you could possibly hope to make in r, but it gives you simple reproducible code to go along with it. This site similarly caters for python, and D3 (would love to learn more D3, so watch this space). It also links to their award winning [data-to-vis](https://www.data-to-viz.com/#explore) websites, which offers a [decision tree](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) (under the 'explore' tab) to pick appropriate visual along with the relevant caveats. 

- GGplot2 book by hadley is the definitive guide for ggplot2, which is the go-to vis package in R. I always like to invest in a hardcopy, more likely to actually read it.

- Cedrics ggplot2 [tutrial](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/#panels) is a great place to go if you're looking to be inspred. Or infact any/all of his [visualisations](https://www.cedricscherer.com/top/dataviz/)

## Other great books/sites

- For learning markdown [this](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) is great interactive tutrial.

- [An introduction to statisical learning with applications in R](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ff2adbe3fe4fe33db902812/t/6062a083acbfe82c7195b27d/1617076404560/ISLR%2BSeventh%2BPrinting.pdf). A great book for understanding the key ideas in ML, offers a readable and no-nonsense introduction. Although I find the "application in R" a bit outdataed 'base R'-y for my liking, the funenmental concepts have stood the test of time. 

- [Regex](https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html) is like a superpower. Once you know it, you'll wonder how you ever got by without it. The good news is, it is more important to know what is possible, that remember exactly how to implement it

## Amazing Websites that deserve more attention

- Have you ever wished you know more about git? (the answer should always be yes)
[git-school](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) have created this neat little webpage that helps you visualise what goes on when you hit that dreaded git pull.

- CSS selectors, useful for telling a computer which part of a webpage you want it to select 
[flukeout](https://flukeout.github.io/) does an incredible job at game-ifying CSS selection. If you're not careful, you won't even realise you're learning. 

- [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/) makes you think about randomness

- [Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) is website dedicated to cool visualization. Worth checking out for some inspo.


## Less-well-known Packages I dig

- [SkimR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/skimr.html) - provide summary statistics about variables in data frames


## Pictures speak louder than definitions
