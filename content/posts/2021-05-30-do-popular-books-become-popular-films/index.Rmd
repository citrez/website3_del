I was watching one of the Harry Potter films for the umpteenth time, wondering how such a mediocre film went on to be such huge box office hit. The answer is obvious, the books were hugely popular, and there are hundreds of millions of loyal fans who would watch the film regardless of the quality. In general though, will a popular book always do well when converted to a film. What is the relationship like between books sales and box office success and which films are the exceptionss? To what extent can i use book sales as a predictor of box office success?

First things first, lets collect some data.
We need information on book sales and gross movie sales. 

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,message = F,warning = F,cache = T )
```


```{r load_packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

Wikipedia often has great tables with this type of information. I'm going to scrape all the book sales data I need from [this]() wiki page.
![](/post_popular_books/wiki.png)
I want to use all this book sales data for my analysis, however, there are over 300 rows, its too much to copy out manually, or even copy and paste. This is a great opportunity to try out rvest, R's webscraping package. 


```{r}
book_wiki_page <- 
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_individual_books"

book_html <- xml2::read_html(book_wiki_page)
```

It's hard to get very far in webscraping without at least a very basic understanding of
the language which deicde how things are styled and layed out on a webpage (HTML and CSS).

This peice of code tells the computer where to look in the webpage to get the table data we're looking for. 

```{r}
all_tables <- book_html %>% 
  html_nodes(css = "table.wikitable.sortable" ) 
all_tables
```

We now have a list, containing all the tables on the webpage, we want to turn all these individual tables into nice dataframe, and then combine all those 15 dataframes in to a master dataframe with all the information in it. `map_dfr` applied `parse_table` to each tables and then sticks them all together. 

```{r}
parse_table <- function(x) {
  html_table(x,fill=T) %>%
    as_tibble() %>% 
    mutate(across( everything(), as.character ) )
}

combined_table <- map_dfr(all_tables,parse_table)
```

As is often the case with scraped data, this is far from clean. We have a `No. of installments` and a `No. of instalments` column. Lets merge them into one.

```{r}
combined_table <- combined_table %>% 
  mutate(`No. of installments` = coalesce(`No. of installments`,`No. of instalments`)) %>% 
  select(-`No. of instalments`)
```


The `Approximate sales` is very messy, and it the column we are most concerned about, to lets take care to make sure we extract all the data.  

```{r}
combined_table <- combined_table %>%
  mutate(
    `Approximate sales_clean` = str_remove(`Approximate sales`, '(\\[\\d+\\])+'),
    `Approximate sales_numb` = str_extract(`Approximate sales`, '[\\d,\\.]+'),
    `Approximate sales_multiplier` = if_else(
      str_detect(`Approximate sales`, 'million'),
      10 **6,1),
    `Approximate sales_numb` = str_remove_all(`Approximate sales_numb`,','),
    `Approximate sales_numb` = as.double(`Approximate sales_numb`),
      `Approximate sales_dbl` = `Approximate sales_numb` * `Approximate sales_multiplier`) %>% 
  select( -`Approximate sales_clean`,- `Approximate sales_numb`, -`Approximate sales_multiplier`)
```


Now we've cleaned our master tables, some are series, some are individual books.

```{r}
book_series_table <- combined_table %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Book series`)) %>% 
  select(-Book) %>% select( `Book series`,everything())

book_table <- combined_table %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Book)) %>% 
  select(-`Book series`,-`No. of installments`)
```

One last cleanup on the books table
```{r}
book_table <- book_table %>% 
  mutate(
    `First published_cleaned` = case_when(
      `First published` == '18th century' ~ '1800', 
      TRUE ~ `First published`),
    `First published_cleaned` = str_extract(`First published_cleaned`,'\\d+'),
    `First published_cleaned` = lubridate::as_date(paste0(`First published_cleaned`,"-01-01") ) )
```
