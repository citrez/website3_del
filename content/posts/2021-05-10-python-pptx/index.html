<p>Automate Power point generation.
Here’s the problem, you are are asked to run some analysis and generate a report for a population.
You produce some great work, creating some really stylish works that answers all all the questions and tells a great story. Then comes the inevitable “… and what does this look like for the US only…”</p>
<p>In this blog i’ll show you how to automate creating sub reports in powerpoint. We’ll use this employee dataset which you can find it on <a href="www.google.com">kaggle</a>. Each row is a new person in the company and we are given given information such as where the employee is married, thier ethncity, thier pay and how satisfied they are as employees.</p>
<p>I’m going to produce a mock report of all 311 employees, and then automate the generation of separate sub-reports for each department.</p>
<p>First things first, lets read it the data.</p>
