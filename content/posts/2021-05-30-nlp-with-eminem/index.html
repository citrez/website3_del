<p>For a while I thought it‚Äôd be fun to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques on artists lyrics - and see what it comes up with, whether the analysis chimes with our experience of listening to the artist.</p>
<p>Picking a rapper would be a good choice, purely because they give us more words than other artists.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to split this out into a 5 series of blog posts, each focusing on different aspects of NLP.
- Predictive modeling with NLP
- Network structure
- Topic analysis with NLP</p>

<h2>TF-IDF Between Albums</h2>
<p>TF-IDF is term frequency inverse document frequency. This translates to, ‚ÄúDoes a word come up in this album significantly more than in comes up in others‚Äù. The word ‚ÄúThe‚Äù for example, will probably come up a lot in the album infinite, however, it‚Äôll come up a lot in the rest of the albums too, so won‚Äôt have a high TF-IDF. However, <strong>give an example</strong></p>
