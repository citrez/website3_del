## Intro 

Managing your files usually boils down to 3 things.  

1. Creating them
2. Deleting them
3. Moving/Renaming them

No doubt, you've done all of these things many times with something like this

That is great, and works very well for *90%* of cases. But, what happens when you have 3,000 files and you need to rename all of then, do you really want to be clicking through each of them and changing them individually?

This is when a less graphical-user-interface reliant work-flow can really come in handy. I'll be setting up a dummy problem and showing you how to solve it with the neat `fs` package in R. 

For me, file manipulation is one of those tool to have in your data science toolkit that you may not use everyday, but once in a while you'll look like a magician and be very happy you know about it. 

```{r setup, echo =F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, message = F,warning = F,cache = T )
```

## Using the fs Package

### Create a folder
This will be a dummy folder that we'll delete at the end, so feel free to follow along and not worry that you'll accidentally delete your the entire contents of your computer.


```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(fs)
dir_create('dummy_folder')
```

### Add some files

Now lets make 1,000 files. The beauty of the fs package is that the functions are vecotrised. Meaning, you pass in a vector and it applies the function on all the elements of the vector successively. This saves us the messy step of looping or passing to a map function. The path() function from fs, helps us stick file paths together. 

```{r , echo=T}
file_create(path = path('dummy_folder',paste0('test_',1:12) ), ext = 'txt' )
```

### Look at the contents for folders
Now we can explore what is it this folder using dir_ls
```{r}
dir_ls('dummy_folder')
```

Or if we want that in a tidy tibble...

```{r}
dir_info('dummy_folder')
```

or if we want a tree of the structure...

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path = 'dummy_folder',recurse = 2)
```

### Combine using the pipe
Here's the cool part, we can pipe one function into another, so deleting everything in a folder is as simple and readable as this. dir_ls lists the content of the folder and file_delete is a vectorised function that deletes all files in the folder. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% file_delete()
```

What about changing file names? Also easy. (changing file names in equivalent to 'moving' them to a file with a different name)

```{r}
 file_move(path = dir_ls('dummy_folder'),
           new_path = dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% str_replace('test','train'))
```

### Now lets detele this dummy folder

```{r}
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% file_delete()
```

### 'Real World' Use Case

A real word use case may be something like this:
You have a messy folder with all types of files that have dates in the file name.
You want to organise them into a separate folders for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.

```{r}
create_dummy_file_names <- function(n = 3){
  years <- 2018:2021
  months <- stringr::str_pad(1:12,width = 2,side = 'left',pad = '0')
  days <- stringr::str_pad(1:31,width = 2,side = 'left',pad = '0')
  file_names <- paste(
    sample(years,replace = T,size  = n),
    sample(months,replace = T,size = n),
    sample(days,replace = T,size = n),
    sep = '-')
  
  file_names <- paste0('file_',file_names)
}


file_create(path = 
              path(
                'dummy_folder',
                create_dummy_file_names(200) ),
            ext = 'txt' )

dir_ls('dummy_folder')[1:10]
```

```{r}
dir_create(path('dummy_folder',2018:2021))

dir_info_dummy_folder <- dir_info('dummy_folder') %>% # get a df with file info
  select(path) %>%
  filter(fs::is_file(path)) %>% # checks
  mutate(year = str_extract(path,'\\d{4}'),
         new_path =path(fs::path_dir(path),year,fs::path_file(path)), # extract only the directory part of file path
         )

  
```


```{r}
file_move(dir_info_dummy_folder$path,dir_info_dummy_folder$new_path)
```

Done!

And that was all done within the comfort of a tibble.

### Clean up

```{r}
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% file_delete()
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% dir_delete()
```
