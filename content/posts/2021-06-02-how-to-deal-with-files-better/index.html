<p>Managing your files boils down to 3 things. Creating them, deleting them and moving them.
All of these things you have probably done countless times, by clicking on files in a window that looks very much like this
<img src="finder.png" alt="finder" /></p>
<p>That is all fine, and works very well for 90% of cases. But, what happens when you have 2000 files and you need to rename all of then, do you really want to be clicking through each of them? This is when a less graphical-user-interface reliance workflow can really come in handy. Iâ€™ll be setting up a dummy problem and showing you how to solve it with the <code>fs</code> package in R.</p>
