<p style="text-align: center;">Here is a collection of things that I love to use.
I hope to update this regularly</p>

## R and packages
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for me is the definitive guide to Data Science in R and can help you think about data problems. It is both highly approachable and will really get you quite far along with your data needs.

- *The* resource for building package in R. [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham.
- I used hugo and blogdown to create this site. [The blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is the best place to start and [this blog](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/) is a nice primer.

- [Tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) for interpretable ways of gaining insight from text data
