# My Story

Hi, welcome to my blog!
I'm a maths graduate now working as a data scientist in the city of London.

I'll be using this blog to write up about data science ideas that I feel are worth sharing. Feel free to leave a comment beneath my posts a get involved. I don't get to do much writing in my day job, so I also want to use this as a way improve my ability to communicate. 

This is my first (very) tentative step into any form of website development, so I hope this will only start to look better the more i learn about web technologies.
