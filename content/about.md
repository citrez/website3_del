# About me

Hi, welcome to my blog!
I'm a maths graduate now working as a data scientist in London.

 Feel free to leave a comment beneath my posts a get involved. I don't get to do much writing in my day job, so I also want to use this as a way improve my ability to communicate. 

# About my blog

This is my first (**very**) tentative step into any form of website development, so I hope this will only start to look better the more i learn about web technologies. 


I'll be using this blog to write up about data science ideas that I feel are worth sharing.
Right now my main interests are in ML, text analysis, data-vis and R, who I'll be focusing on those 4 things for now, but that might change with time.
