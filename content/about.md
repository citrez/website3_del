# About me

Hi, welcome to my blog!
I studies maths an uni and am now working as a data scientist in London.

I started this blog as a project during the covid pandemic, and really enjoyed the process of building and styling a website. This is my first (**very**) tentative step into any form of website development, so I hope this will only start to look better the more i learn about the underlying technologies. 
I think there are loads of good reason to write a blog, improving communication, motivating yourself to learn new things and 'giving back' to the community, to name just a few.

# About my blog

I read about the idea of a ([digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) a few months ago, and it really resonated with me. I think of it as somewhere between a blog and a personal notepad, a place on the internet where you can leave your mark and others can come to explore your thoughts and ideas. 

I'll be using this blog to write up about data science ideas that I feel are worth sharing.
Right now my main interests are in ML, text analysis, data-vis and R, so I'll be focusing on
these 4 things for now, but that might change with time.
