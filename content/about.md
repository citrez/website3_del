# About me

Hi, welcome to my blog!
I studies maths an uni and am now working as a data scientist in London.

I started this blog as a project during the covid pandemic, and really enjoyed the process of building and styling a website. This is my first (**very**) tentative step into any form of website development, so I hope this will only start to look better the more I learn about the underlying technologies. 
I think there are loads of good reason to write a blog, improving communication, motivating yourself to learn new things and 'giving back' to the community, to name just a few.

# About my blog

I read about the idea of a [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) a few months ago, and it really resonated with me. I think of this this website as somewhere between a blog and a personal notepad, a place on the internet where I can leave your mark and others can come to explore your thoughts and ideas. 

I'll be using this blog to write up about data science ideas that I feel are worth sharing.
Right now my main interests are in ML, text analysis, data-vis and R, so I'll be focusing on
these 4 things for now, but that might change with time.
